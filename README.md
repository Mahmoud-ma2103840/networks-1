# Advanced Network Design with VLSM

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive network design utilizing VLSM for efficient IP address usage across multiple cities. It includes a simulated environment where various network services are implemented. **Due to GitHub's file size limit the .pkt was not uploaded. Contact if needed.**

## Features
- Detailed subnetting for multiple locations.
- Configuration of network services: DNS, Web, Email, FTP.
- IPv4 and IPv6 address planning.
- WAN and LAN connectivity tests.

## How to Use
- Download the `.pkt` file to load the project in Packet Tracer.
- Explore the subnetting scheme provided in the `Network Project Report`.
- Test the connectivity and services as outlined in the documentation.

## Prerequisites
- Cisco Packet Tracer for `.pkt` files.
- A document viewer for `.docx` files.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository, adjust the network designs, add new services, or improve the existing documentation.
